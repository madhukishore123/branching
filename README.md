					<h1>Master Branch: </h1>
					<p> Master must contain well tested code, application release happens from this branch by     
  creating a release ‘tag’.
  In real world no one directly work on master.</p>
					<h1>Hotfixs Branch: </h1>
					<p>This branch is used for fixing production defects.
   Hotfixes branch is created from master</p>
					<h1>Develop Branch</h1>
					<p>This branch belongs to a specific team, code integration of this team members are 
  done on this branch
Develop branch is created from master</p>
					<h1>Feature Branch</h1>
					<p> Belongs to a specific developer, where his feature in implemented, after completion of 
  a feature changes are merged into his develop branch.
  Feature branch is created from develop branch.The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the master branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments</p>
					<h1>Release Branch</h1>
  This branch is to integrate changes done by multiple teams under their develop branch
